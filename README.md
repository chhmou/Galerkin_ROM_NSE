# üåÄ Galerkin Reduced-Order Model (G-ROM) for 2D Navier‚ÄìStokes Equations

This repository provides a MATLAB implementation of a **Galerkin Reduced-Order Model (G-ROM)** for the two-dimensional incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations

The code demonstrates how to construct and evolve a low-dimensional model using **POD (Proper Orthogonal Decomposition)** basis functions extracted from high-fidelity DNS data. It compares the G-ROM solution against the full-order model (FOM / DNS) in terms of kinetic energy and $L^2$ error.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **MATLAB R2020b** or later  
- Toolboxes: *none required beyond base MATLAB*  
- System: macOS, Windows, or Linux  

Optional: For large data handling, ensure MATLAB supports the `-v7.3` MAT-file format.
